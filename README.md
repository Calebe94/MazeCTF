## Motivation

I have made this game as a college project. The idea was to make a game in JAVA.
My idea was to create a **Capture the Flag** type of game in which we would have two players playing simultaneously in a Maze.

The player which brings the oponent's flag to its own base, wins the game.

## Considerations

This game was developed with educational purpose.
